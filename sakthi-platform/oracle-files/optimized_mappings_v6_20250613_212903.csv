Customer_Account,ANB_CHEETAH_ACCOUNT_ACCOUNT_RELATIONSHIPS_ID,PERS,spousepersnbr,1:1,60.0,enhanced_llm_mapping,"Enhanced LLM mapping: Given the target column `ANB_CHEETAH_ACCOUNT_ACCOUNT_RELATIONSHIPS_ID` is an integer representing a customer identifier for linking records, and within the provided source options, only `PERS.spousepersnbr` is an integer and seems likely to be a personal identifier (potentially a spouse's ID within the PERS table â€“ a customer table).  While the 'spouse' aspect isn't ideal, it's the closest semantically related field that is numerically typed as an identifier. The other fields in `PERS` appear to be descriptive attributes (name, codes). Linking account relationships might involve a spouse's ID in certain scenarios (joint accounts, beneficiary, etc.).  It's crucial to investigate further whether `spousepersnbr` actually represents a unique customer identifier or just a link to another person record.  The 60% confidence reflects this uncertainty and requires additional validation.",Data field spousepersnbr in PERS,Data field spousepersnbr in PERS,integer,integer,239d14a1-cd69-df48-dd18-7d9b21549284,[],5302.791595458984,sequential_3
Customer_Account,ANB_CHEETAH_ACCOUNTRELATIONSHIPS_IDENTITYRECORDS_ID,PERS,spousepersnbr,1:1,60.0,enhanced_llm_mapping,"Enhanced LLM mapping: Given the target column's description as a ""Customer identifier for linking records"" and its integer data type, PERS.spousepersnbr is the most likely candidate among the provided options.  In banking, customer identifiers are frequently numeric. While 'spousepersnbr' suggests a spousal relationship, it's plausible that this field represents a unique identifier for a person, and the 'spouse' context might be relevant to a specific subset of relationships within the customer data.  It's not ideal, but it's the best numerical option available.  We'd strongly prefer a dedicated customer ID field (like a `cust_id` or `client_id`) from a CUST or Customer table if one were present in the source.  Without more source context, we're making an educated guess based on data type compatibility.",Data field spousepersnbr in PERS,Data field spousepersnbr in PERS,integer,integer,774098b5-a066-ceb8-7590-71eb021c6e6f,[],4712.947130203247,sequential_4

Customer_Address,ANB_CUSTOMER_ID,PERS,spousepersnbr,1:1,60.0,enhanced_llm_mapping,"Enhanced LLM mapping: While none of the provided source columns are ideal, `PERS.spousepersnbr` being an integer suggests a personal identifier.  In a banking context, if the `PERS` table relates to persons associated with a customer, it's plausible that `spousepersnbr` might contain the customer ID of the primary account holder if the record represents a spouse. This is a somewhat weak assumption, as it's more common for each person to have their own unique identifier.  More context about the `PERS` table is needed for greater certainty.  It is HIGHLY recommended to investigate if a dedicated customer identifier exists within the PERS table or a related customer table.",Data field spousepersnbr in PERS,Data field spousepersnbr in PERS,integer,integer,aa5e8d2a-1271-7e26-7caf-d7f109a8cebd,[],4031.1172008514404,sequential_7
